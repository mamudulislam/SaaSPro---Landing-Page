- **Elite Typography**: Sophisticated pairing of `Outfit` (Headings) and `Public Sans` (Body).
- **Comparison Logic**: Professional "SaaSPro vs Competitors" section to build authority.
- **Advanced Micro-interactions**: GSAP-powered reveals, Lenis smooth scrolling, and icon feedback.
- **Brand System**: A cohesive color system with high-end indigo/violet gradients and luxury dark mode.
